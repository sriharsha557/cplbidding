# CPL 2025 Auction Rules & Process

## Overview

The Colruyt Premier League (CPL) 2025 uses a **Category-Based Auction System** designed to ensure fair distribution of players across all teams. This system prevents any single team from dominating by acquiring all the best players in one category.

---

## Team Structure

### Pre-Assigned Players (Before Auction)
Each team starts with **2 pre-assigned players**:
- **1 Captain** 👑
- **1 Vice-Captain** 🥈

These players are already assigned to their teams and will NOT participate in the auction.

### Squad Composition
- **Squad Size Range**: 11-16 players per team
- **Available Slots for Auction**: 9-14 players (plus 2 pre-assigned)
- **Minimum Squad**: 11 players (9 from auction + 2 pre-assigned)
- **Maximum Squad**: 16 players (14 from auction + 2 pre-assigned)

---

## Budget System

### Total Budget
Each team receives: **1,200 tokens** 🪙

### Category-Based Budget Allocation

The budget is divided across 4 player categories to ensure balanced team composition:

| Category | Min Budget | Max Budget | Min Players | Max Players | Available Players |
|----------|-----------|-----------|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Batsmen** 🏏 | 250 tokens | 350 tokens | 3 players | 4 players | 31 |
| **All-rounders** ⭐ | 200 tokens | 350 tokens | 3 players | 5 players | 33 |
| **Bowlers** ⚾ | 200 tokens | 300 tokens | 2 players | 3 players | 21 ⚠️ |
| **WicketKeepers** 🧤 | 100 tokens | 200 tokens | 1 player | 2 players | 14 ⚠️ |

**⚠️ Note:** Bowlers and WicketKeepers are in LIMITED supply. Competition will be intense!

**Key Points:**
- Teams MUST spend at least the minimum budget in each category
- Teams CANNOT exceed the maximum budget in any category
- Teams MUST acquire at least the minimum number of players per category
- Teams CANNOT exceed the maximum number of players per category

## How Bidding Works

### Base Price
- Each player has a **base price** (minimum bid amount)
- Bidding starts at the base price
- Teams can bid higher in increments of 5 tokens

### Live Auction Screen
The admin panel displays:
- **Current Player**: Photo, name, role, base price
- **Team Budgets**: Remaining tokens for each team
- **Category Budget**: Remaining budget for the current player's category
- **Affordability Check**: Real-time validation if a team can afford the bid

### Bidding Rules
1. **Auction Timer**: 60 seconds per player
2. **Open Bidding**: Teams call out their bids verbally
3. **Admin Records**: The auction admin enters the final winning bid
4. **Validation**: System automatically checks:
   - Does the team have enough total tokens?
   - Does the team have enough category budget?
   - Does the team have space in their squad?
   - Does the team have space for this role?

### Outcomes
- **Sold**: Player is assigned to the winning team
- **Unsold**: If no team bids, player is marked as unsold

## Fair Distribution Mechanism

### Why Category-Based Budgets?

**Problem Without Categories:**
- A rich team could spend 800 tokens on 5 star batsmen
- Other teams would be left with weaker batsmen
- Unfair competition

**Solution With Categories:**
- Maximum 400 tokens can be spent on batsmen
- Forces teams to distribute spending across all categories
- Ensures every team gets quality players in each role

### Example Scenario

**Team A's Budget Status:**
- Total Tokens Left: 800 🪙
- Batsman Budget Left: 50 🪙
- Bowler Budget Left: 350 🪙

**Current Player:** A star batsman with base price 40 tokens

**Can Team A bid 100 tokens?**
- ✅ Total tokens available: 800 (enough)
- ❌ Batsman budget available: 50 (NOT enough)
- **Result:** Team A can only bid up to 50 tokens

This prevents Team A from overspending on batsmen and forces balanced spending.

## Strategy Tips

### For Team Managers

1. **Plan Your Budget**
   - Decide how much to spend on star players vs. budget players
   - Don't exhaust your category budget too early

2. **Balance Your Squad**
   - Aim for a mix of experienced and new players
   - Ensure you meet minimum requirements in each category

3. **Watch Competitors**
   - Track other teams' remaining budgets
   - Identify when teams are running low on category budgets

4. **Save for Key Players**
   - Don't spend all your budget in early phases
   - Keep tokens for critical roles (e.g., wicketkeepers are limited)

### For Players

1. **Understand Your Value**
   - Your base price reflects your skill level
   - Higher base price = higher demand

2. **Category Matters**
   - All-rounders and wicketkeepers are in high demand (fewer slots)
   - Batsmen and bowlers have more slots available

3. **Timing is Everything**
   - Being auctioned early vs. late in your category affects your price
   - Teams with more budget left tend to bid higher
